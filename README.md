# 📄 Abstract

ElderEase is a modular, real-time health monitoring system designed to simulate and analyze vital health parameters of elderly individuals.  

Phase 1 establishes a rule-based monitoring architecture using Node-RED, enabling structured health data simulation, validation, classification, and logging.  

The system follows an event-driven, flow-based design and is built entirely using open-source technologies to ensure FOSS compliance.  

This phase serves as the foundational layer for future expansions including database integration, full-stack web dashboards, and machine learning-based predictive analytics.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Elderly individuals living independently face significant health risks such as:

- Sudden heart rate spikes  
- Low oxygen saturation  
- Fever episodes  
- Lack of continuous monitoring  

Most existing systems are reactive and hardware-dependent. ElderEase aims to create a scalable monitoring architecture starting with a simulated real-time pipeline.

- `userId`
- `deviceId`
- `heartRate`
- `spo2`
- `temperature`
- `timestamp`
- `systemVersion`

---

## 🔹 2. Data Validation Module

The **Data Validation Module** ensures that all simulated health readings fall within realistic physiological ranges before further processing.

### Validation Ranges

- **Heart Rate:** 40–180 bpm  
- **SpO₂:** 70–100 %  
- **Temperature:** 34–42 °C  

### Functionality

- Verifies each incoming reading.
- Flags invalid or out-of-range values.
- Logs invalid readings for monitoring.
- Appends `valid` and `error` fields.
- Preserves structured payload integrity.
- Prevents corrupted data from entering the decision engine.

### Example (Invalid Flagged Output)

```
{
  "heartRate": 220,
  "spo2": 95,
  "temperature": 36.9,
  "valid": false,
  "error": "Heart Rate out of realistic range"
}
```

## 🔹 3. Decision Engine Module

The **Decision Engine Module** performs rule-based classification of validated health readings.

It analyzes processed data and determines the real-time health status of the monitored individual.

---

### 📊 Status Categories

- NORMAL
- WARNING
- EMERGENCY

---

### ⚙️ Rule Logic (Phase 1)

- heartRate > 110 → EMERGENCY
- spo2 < 90 → EMERGENCY
- temperature > 38°C → EMERGENCY
- Borderline conditions → WARNING
- Otherwise → NORMAL

{
  "status": "EMERGENCY",
  "reason": "Low Oxygen Level",
  "riskLevel": 3,
  "timestamp": "2026-03-01T14:00:00"
}
```

### 🚦 Risk Level Mapping

| Risk Level | Status |
|------------|---------|
| 1 | NORMAL |
| 2 | WARNING |
| 3 | EMERGENCY |
